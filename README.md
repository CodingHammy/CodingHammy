# Welcome to Will Hamiltons's GitHub Profile

Hello there! I'm a self-taught React developer navigating the complex world of coding while juggling the responsibilities of a full-time live-in caregiving role. Currently I undertaking a HyperionDev Bootcamp, to hone my skills and to fill any gaps in my knowledge.


Coding presents constant challenges, and I thrive on overcoming them. Despite the late nights and hurdles, I persist, driven by the satisfaction of problem-solving and the sense of accomplishment when overcoming obstacles. Along the way, I've honed valuable skills such as problem-solving, organization, self-motivation, hard work, determination, independence, and time management. These skills contribute to my ability to navigate and conquer the challenges of coding.

## Currently


Through an intensive course, I'm refining my frontend skills and acquiring new competencies in backend essentials such as MongoDB, Node.js for server-side development, and effective database management. This comprehensive training not only polishes my existing frontend knowledge but also equips me with the necessary tools to excel in backend development.

## Projects

Currently, I'm working on a variety of projects to showcase my skills and demonstrate my passion for coding. Here are a few of them:
