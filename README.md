# Welcome to my GitHub Profile

Hello there! I'm a self-taught React developer navigating the complex world of coding while juggling the responsibilities of a full-time live-in caregiving role. Currently I undertaking a HyperionDev Bootcamp, to hone my skills and to fill any gaps in my knowledge.


Coding presents constant challenges, and I thrive on overcoming them. Despite the late nights and hurdles, I persist, driven by the satisfaction of problem-solving and the sense of accomplishment when overcoming obstacles. Along the way, I've honed valuable skills such as problem-solving, organization, self-motivation, hard work, determination, independence, and time management. These skills contribute to my ability to navigate and conquer the challenges of coding.

## Currently


Through an intensive course, I'm refining my frontend skills and acquiring new competencies in backend essentials such as MongoDB, Node.js for server-side development, and effective database management. This comprehensive training not only polishes my existing frontend knowledge but also equips me with the necessary tools to excel in backend development.

## Projects

Currently, I'm working on a variety of projects to showcase my skills and demonstrate my passion for coding. Here are a few of them:

- **GreenStore**
 
    Repo: https://github.com/CodingHammy/GreenStore: | Demo: https://green-store-three.vercel.app/
    
    Greenstore is a personal website showcasing 24 months of web development expertise. It features project highlights, coding challenges, and a fully functional shopping cart seamlessly integrated with a database. Utilizing JavaScript, React, CSS, Next.js, Redux, and Mapbox, Greenstore offers visitors an immersive experience into the creator's knowledge and accomplishments in web development.


  
- **TanzWerk**

    Repo: https://github.com/CodingHammy/Tanzwerk | Demo: https://tanzwerkmensch.de

    Tanzwerk is a website I developed in September of last year for a dynamic dance studio based in Germany. Drawing on my self-taught skills in HTML, CSS, and foundational JavaScript, I designed this platform to serve as a vibrant online hub for the dance community. It showcases the studio's offerings, schedules, and an engaging user experience, reflecting the energy and artistry of dance. Tanzwerk is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and the fusion of technology and creativity in the world of web development.
